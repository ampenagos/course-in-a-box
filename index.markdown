## Creating and Maintaining an Open Internet for Everyone

Today, the Internet is an integral part of everyday life, driving how we work, study, and socialize. The Internet facilitated an explosion in access to knowledge and information, but at the same time that the digital era empowered citizens to do and say more than ever before, it also made all of us more vulnerable to intrusions of all kinds. Technology has empowered governments and companies just as much as it has empowered us as citizens.
 
In this context, dealing with digital rights in an effective manner requires multidisciplinary knowledge that includes basic advocacy skill and a base-level understanding of the most debated Internet-related issues of the 2010’s. A well-prepared civil society, judiciary system, policy makers, and activists with diverse skill sets are all essential to meeting the challenges posed in the digital era.
 
Through a series of interactive materials and activities including toolkits, expert video interviews, and online discussion boards, this course will train a new generation of thinkers and actors to propose and execute an open internet policy agenda with a human rights approach to internet policy. 

The first module of this course, Module 0, will be an introduction into what we mean by “Open Internet” and the issues that fall within that realm. Modules 1-5 will give an in-depth look at advocacy tools and strategic plans that will provide the organizing skills needed to advocate on behalf on Open Internet. The final five modules, Module 6-10, will provide an overview of the Open Internet related issues including human rights, network neutrality, and access to Internet. By the end of the course, participants should feel that they have a base-level understanding of human rights advocacy, major issues that impact the Internet, and where they can work, especially within the Internet governance framework, to advocate for improvement in these areas.
		
## What are the course objectives?

## How to Use This Course

The course materials can be used to provide the basis for a facilitated distance learning course in which the instructor will be available to assist in assignments and inquiries, but the student should complete assignments and readings remotely. This course requires approximately 2 hours of study time per module during the both the instructor facilitated and self-taught learning format. The working language of the course is Spanish or English, though a large portion of assigned external readings are in English.

For each module, you will see the title of the module, a list of objectives, the original content background, readings, and assignments. For participant suggested reading, if as a participant you have suggestions for applicable readings in English or Spanish, please add them to the course discussion board topic entitled “Participant Suggested Reading” and include the applicable module number.
