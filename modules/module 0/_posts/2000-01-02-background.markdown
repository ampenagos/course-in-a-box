Before you continue, watch [this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVTUi6wWN3M&list=UUwephXhp75_UN-ItwM8A-4w)  on a brief history of the Internet: 

In the past few decades, the Internet has revolutionized people’s ability to access information and express themselves creatively, politically, socially, and economically. For some, the internet is useful for doing research or connecting with friends after class, while for others it is a means to communicate with family thousands of miles away or work on impactful projects across borders. However, for many people  the Internet is still a far-away source of economic, creative, and social opportunity that is not yet accessible or affordable. 

For a moment, think about how different your life would be without access to a free and open Internet. Would you be working with the same people? Would you have found the same job or school that you are at now? Would you be different at all? Chances are, that the Internet has changed your life and the lives of those around you more than you know. For those who have access to an open and free Internet, it provides access to education, governance tools, economic development, media and entertainment, health resources, and many other things. The Internet impacts our daily lives or our future lives, which is why it’s important for us to remember that protecting the future of Internet (and helping give Internet access to those who don’t have it) is necessary for protecting the future of our basic human rights and sustainability.  

###**Human Rights Principles and the Internet**

Globally, the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is often referred to as the primary basis for human rights principles for all humans today. Agreed upon in 1948, the declaration includes freedom of expression, the right to privacy, freedom of opinion, freedom of speech, and freedom of association as some of the most basic rights of all humans. While there is no enforcement mechanism for UDHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), adopted by the UN in 1966 reiterates the same values and is a binding multilateral treaty. Another relevant international instrument is the UN’s International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and that treaty includes the right to education, the right to science and culture, and the right to development, just to name a few.

In Latin America, the Organization of American States’ American Convention on Human Rights is the primary basis for human rights principles and enforcement in the Americas. Agreed upon in 1969, the convention guarantees many of the same rights as UDHR, including the right to privacy, freedom of assembly, and freedom of thought and expression. Unlike UDHR, the American Convention on Human Rights is binding to all member states of the Organization of American States (OAS), which includes most of the independent countries of the Americas.

UDHR, ICCPR, ICESCR and the American Convention on Human Rights guarantee the aforementioned rights regardless of the platform. While individual countries and governments have interpreted UDHR and the American Convention on Human Rights principles in varying degrees in the offline world, the development of various ICTs in the past few decades, especially the Internet, has challenged how governments deal with human rights online. The creation of the Internet has profoundly changed how the world’s citizens express their rights, especially freedom of expression. Where in the past citizens may have only voiced their woes with their government in the streets, people of all ages and backgrounds may do the same except via an online petition, sending an email to their government officials, writing an anonymous blog post, or posting a tweet. 

In response to the increasing relevance of the Internet as a platform for expressing basic human rights, in 2011, the OAS Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression,along with the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression and free expression rapporteurs from Europe and Africa signed a joint declaration confirming that “freedom of expression applies to the Internet”. In July 2012 the UN Human Rights Council further confirmed that “the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online,” thus making the formerly mentioned UDHR, ICCPR, and the American Convention the basis of Open Internet principles. 


###**What is the Open Internet and Other Principles for the Open Internet**

Though there is no internationally agreed upon definition, the concept of “Open Internet” refers to the idea that the Internet is an open and free platform where all people can innovate and decide what to access and how to use it without interference and blocking. A number of organizations and bodies have also developed definitions that will be helpful to keep in mind throughout the course and when you’re creating your individual definitions. In 2005, the United States’ Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted four principles for the Open Internet that included consumers’ right to access lawful Internet content, run applications and services of their choosing, connect devices to the network, and choose network and service providers, though these principles are still being debated today.

Remember not to take for granted that not all advocates are fighting to preserve the Open Internet, but to create an Open Internet in their community. While Open Internet principles include freedom of expression, the right to privacy, freedom of opinion, freedom of speech, and freedom of association, they are not restricted to only those rights mentioned in UDHR and the American Convention.  The importance of Internet in the everyday lives of billions of people is undeniable, but more than half of the world’s population still does not have access to internet and most of those without access are located in the Global South. There are a number of causes for the “digital divide” that will be discussed in Module 7, but without access to internet, citizens are limited in their ability to access information and engage in economic, educational, political, and cultural opportunities. This can have negative impacts on not only the individual, but the society they are apart of. Lack of access to internet limits peoples’ abilities to exercise their basic human rights, and so the availability of affordable internet access is a key principle for Open Internet.

Once citizens are able to access the Internet (see Module 7 “Access to Internet” for more in-depth discussion), there must be a guarantee that they will be able to access the content they want without discrimination, changes in quality, or interference based on the type of content or service. This is the basis of the principle of net neutrality, another topic that will be looked at more in depth in Module 9. Without net neutrality, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) can block users from visiting certain websites or slow down speeds in order to boost traffic to other websites. Without net neutrality laws and policies, both governments and ISPs could negatively impact the ability of populations to freely express themselves online and access information. Imagine if during a political election season, an ISP could slow down access to one candidate’s website over another or block service to message boards or news websites on election day. Though this scenario may seem unlikely, it is necessary to advocate for policies that will prevent these types of situations from arising.

Before you continue, please watch [this video by FreeNet] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHywlf8ERrY) on net neutrality.   

The combination of international and regional declarations and national laws on human rights and the principles of access and net neutrality have created a surge of internet related human rights principles and ideals drafted by governments, civil society, and others. Some worth mentioning are the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition’s Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the Internet, Article 19’s International Standards on Freedom of Expression Online, CGI.br’s Principles for the Governance and Use of Internet, and the Council of Europe’s Declaration by the Committee of Ministers on Internet Governance Principles. 

You will notice that some of these documents mention “governance” and “internet governance” when discussing proposed principles and rights for Open Internet and internet freedom. Internet governance is a catch all term for the ever-evolving development and implementation of principles, policies, and decision making activities conducted by various players (governments, civil society, private sector, technical community, academia, and others) that impact the Internet.   Internet governance decisions and discussions can range from a meeting with your local communications regulator to working in a large global multi-stakeholder meeting such as the Internet Governance Forum. In order to advocate for the Open Internet and create positive change in Internet policies and rules, it’s important to understand and be active in internet governance. All relevant Internet governance topics will be discussed in depth in the second half of this course.
