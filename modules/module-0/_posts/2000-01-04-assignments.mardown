ASSIGNMENTS:
*Activity 1*: Looking at the definitions and principles for the Open Internet provided in the background material and using the required and additional readings, are there any principles or ideals that you think are missing from this definition? Anything you think should be excluded? If so, develop your own definition of the “Open Internet” and write no more than a paragraph on why you chose this definition.

*Activity 2*: Now that you’ve got an idea of various Open Internet values and your own definition, do you know if your local, regional, or national government has developed any working definitions or statements related to the Internet and human rights, access to Internet, or network neutrality? Are they in line with your views of the Open Internet? Provide links to statements and your analysis in the discussion board.
